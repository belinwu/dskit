# Why DSKit?

We can find a lot of design systems that can help you build any app you want. The problem is that they all are overwhelmingly complicated; this means there is a big learning curve from starting a new project to delivering it to the store.

DSKit will not cover everything, but if it fits your needs it will deliver flawless functionality. It’s the easiest way to make simple iOS Applications and business white labels with great design and Pixel Perfect UI.

#### All you have to do is:

* Chose your components
* Define the application flow
* Define colors, spacings, fonts, and further you don't care about spaces, layout, dimensions, etc.
* DSKit will take care of the rest.

## Installation

DSKit is distributed using the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager). 

To use DSKit within an iOS, then use Xcode’s `File > Add Packages...` menu command to add it to your project.

Then import DSKit wherever you’d like to use it:

```swift
import DSKit
```
